# Heart-Disease-Classification

Machine Learning Classification Techniques Project

[Google Colab Version in Polish (English version will be added later)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BQurSJtiDVbNmMH9IFi7jHqgnVc5w3Nr?usp=sharing)

Explore the world of heart disease classification with various machine learning techniques. The project includes an in-depth analysis using 🌳Random Forest, 🪐Support Vector Machine (SVM) with multiple kernels, 👤K-Nearest Neighbors, and 📈Logistic Regression. The analysis is accompanied by a comprehensive [report](https://github.com/kottoization/ML-Heart-Disease-Classification/blob/main/UM%20-%20sprawozdanie.pdf) in the repository. available as a PDF in the repository.


**Key Project Highlights:**

- Methods: Random Forest, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression

- Data Exploration: Detailed statistical analysis and impact assessment of variables on the predicted outcome.

- Data Preparation: Handling missing data, outliers, and variable modifications.

- Model Interpretability: In-depth analysis using ceteris-paribus profiles, partial dependence plots, and SHAP values.

- Visual Presentation: Clear and concise visualizations to enhance understanding.

- Project Report: Focuses on precise data and result analysis.
